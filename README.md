Employee Management System – Full Stack MERN Project
The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This project helps manage employee data effectively, allowing users to perform all CRUD operations including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employee records. The app features a clean and responsive user interface with secure user authentication powered by JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

The frontend is built with React and makes use of React Router for navigation and Axios for handling API requests. Users can log in to the system, view a list of employees in a table format, and perform actions like edit or view detailed information for each employee. There is also a form for adding new employees to the system. The interface is styled using a combination of inline CSS and modern styling practices to ensure a pleasant user experience.

On the backend, the application is powered by Node.js and Express.js. The server exposes RESTful APIs for authentication and employee operations, with routes protected using middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities. MongoDB is used as the database to store employee and user data, and Mongoose is used as the ODM for interacting with the database.

Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens. After logging in, the token is stored in localStorage and used for accessing protected routes and endpoints. The app also includes middleware for verifying tokens and securing API routes on the server side.

This project is a complete end-to-end system for managing employee records and can be extended with additional features like search, filtering, pagination, or role-based access. It is ideal for learning how full-stack applications work, how to structure a MERN project, and how to integrate frontend and backend systems securely.
